# Lucida
Lucida is an ecosystem of micro-services that make RPC calls using [Apache
Thrift](http://thrift.apache.org/). Each service is built using common Thrift
interface making micro-service communication efficient and flexible. The command
center arbitrates communication between the services. Lucida has been tested with Ubuntu 14.04.

Current micro-services:
- Automatic Speech Recognition (asr)
- Question-Answering (qa)
- Image Matching (imm)
- Tonic Suite (djinntonic)
