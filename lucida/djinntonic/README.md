### Djinn-and-Tonic
In progress adapting for create, learn, infer (cli) setup. Currently includes
tonic-img facial recognitiion pipeline.
- change the `CAFFE` location in `tonic-common/Makefile.config`
- `make` from this directory builds all subdirectories needed.
- go to `djinn/` and look at the README and open the djinn service first,
  optionally testing.
- go to `tonic-img` and follow the README there.
